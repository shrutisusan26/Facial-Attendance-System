# Facial-Attendance-System


A Facial Recognition based Attendance System made for academic institutions.

The software can clean your face data, and store the different faces in the database.

On uploading an image of the class, it automatically picks up the faces of the students prensent, and compares them with the faces in the database, and marks attendance for those found.
